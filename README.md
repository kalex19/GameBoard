## Learning Goals

* Use an API delivered in text format
* Use Expo Audio Sound 
* Create a fun game that models Hangman in concept
* Use new React Native elements i.e. Avatar, Badge, ImageBackground
* Practice an advanced, professional git workflow

## Challenges

* Using Expo Audio Sound to pop the balloon on every incorrect guess
* Navigating past new React Native errors
* Testing React Native

## Successes

* Converting the API
* Implementing new React Native elements
* Creating functionality for incorrect/correct guesses
* Coming up with a concept for a Hangman app that is not explicitly Hangman i.e. WORDPüéàP


## Extensions

* Balloon pop after each incorrect guess
* Balloon animation to make balloon fly away or pop after each incorrect guess
* User can play other users
* User can create an account
* User can choose difficulty level
* Work on speed performance levels so the app and app assets load quicker
