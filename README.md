## Learning Goals

This is a unique opportunity that presents some valuable goals:

* Ultimately, demonstrate knowledge you‚Äôve gained throughout Turing
* Use an agile process to turn well defined requirements into deployed and production ready software
* Gain experience dividing applications into components and domains of responsibilities to facilitate multi-developer teams. 
* Service oriented architecture concepts and patterns are highly encouraged.
* Explore and implement new concepts, patterns, or libraries that have not been explicitly taught while at Turing
* Practice an advanced, professional git workflow (see whole-team expectations)
* Gain more experience using continuous integration tools to build and automate the deployment of features in various environments
* Build applications that execute in development, test, CI, and production environments
* Focus on communication between front-end and back-end teams in order to complete and deploy features that have been outlined by the project spec

## Challenges

* Integrating Speech-To-Text functionality
* Sending an audio file to the backend to be parsed and sent to Google's Speech API and returned as text
* Testing React Native
* Working in the most up-to-date version of React Native one week after version updates

## Successes

* Recieving text from the backend and rendering the text on the frontend
* Testing React Native
* Creating both client and caretaker accounts and functinoality which goes beyond the MVP
* Meeting with Chris DeMars for accessibility advice and implementing his suggestions so the app is accessibile for clients and caretakers

## Extensions

* User can send a notification of task/list completion to the client
* User can navigate the app using Speech-To-Text functionality
